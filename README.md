# UniVie-Algorithms-And-Datastructures-SeparateChaining-Hashtable
The Separate Chaining Hashtable is written in C++!
The Project (Hashtable) works as a end term Project for the subject Algorithms and Datstructures for University of Vienna. There is a whole set class, which is called ADS_set, which resembles the actual set Class, but its on its own way different, so it is easier to work with it. There are also aliases, which help the implementation. 
For testing there are also 2 Test classes, which are NOT implemented from me, but from the University of Vienna IT Direction.
